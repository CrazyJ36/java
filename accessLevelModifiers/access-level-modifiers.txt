if no access modifier is defined for the class file.
(line 1 when defining class), java uses the default class access level: 
package-private, Making the class visible to only its own package. 
Similar to non-open-source, this make this particular programs 
functionality(classes, attributes, and methods) not available to add 
or usein other packages with 'javac --classpath'.

No modifier defined or "package private" =
granted access level: class, package
denied access: subclasses, world


The following choices are available for attributes and methods:

default: A variable or method declared with no access control 
modifier is available to any other class in the same package.

public: Accessible from any other class.

protected: Provides the same access as the default access modifier,
with the addition that subclasses can access
protected methods and variables of the superclass

private: Accessible only within the declared class itself.
